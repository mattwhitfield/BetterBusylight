# Introduction ðŸ‘€

Better Busylight is busy light controller software that changes the light state based on audio sessions, web cam usage and system lock state. It was developed because I wanted the busylight to show I was actually in a call, rather than just red because there was an entry in my calendar.

# Key Features âœ¨

* Activity driven - you specify what your busy light displays in five states
  * When machine is locked
  * When neither camera nor conference audio are active
  * When only conference audio is active
  * When only the camera is active
  * When both conference audio and the camera are active
* Customisable sequences
  * Specify solid colour, a sequence of colours, fades between two colours or any combination of those
  * Specify a frequency at which the light pulses
* Support for multiple busylight devices

# How to run it ðŸš€

BetterBusylight is a .NET Framework application. You can run it on any version of Windows by simply double clicking it. If you want it to run when you log into windows, press Windows+R, then enter `shell:startup`. You can then create a shortcut to the BetterBusylight application which will start when Windows does.

# Configuration ðŸ”§

BetterBusylight is configured by modifying the `config.xml` file in the application directory. Here is the default content of that configuration file:

```
<config>
  <audioDevice searchString="Jabra" />
  <lightStyles>
    <locked>
	  <static color="#141414" />
	</locked>
    <idle>
	  <fade from="#008000" to="#0000FF" duration="1.5" />
	  <fade from="#0000FF" to="#008000" duration="1.5" />
	</idle>
    <audioOnly flashFrequency="0.75">
	  <static color="#ff4000" />
	</audioOnly>
    <cameraOnly flashFrequency="0.75">
	  <static color="#800080" />
	</cameraOnly>
    <audioAndCamera flashFrequency="1.5">
	  <static color="#ff0000" />
	</audioAndCamera>
  </lightStyles>
</config>
```

The `<audioDevice>` node specifies what audio device should be counted as 'Conference Audio'. More on that below...

The `<lightStyles>` node contains the different sequences - `<locked>`, `<idle>`, `<audioOnly>`, `<cameraOnly>` and `<audioAndCamera>`. For each of these, you can optionally specify a frequency at which the light should pulse (in Hz) by adding a `flashFrequency="2"` attribute - where 2 is the desired frequency. You can see in the default config that the audioOnly, cameraOnly and audioAndCamera nodes use a static colour that pulses.

You can add as many elements into each node as you like. For example, if you wanted a rainbow effect when no camera or audio was active, you could configure the `<idle>` node like this:

```
    <idle>
	  <static color="#ff0000" duration="0.5" />
	  <static color="#ffff00" duration="0.5" />
	  <static color="#00ff00" duration="0.5" />
	  <static color="#00ffff" duration="0.5" />
	  <static color="#0000ff" duration="0.5" />
	  <static color="#ff00ff" duration="0.5" />
	</idle>
```

The `<idle>` node, by default, fades from green to blue and back. Again, you can configure it to do whatever you'd like.

# What is 'conference audio'? ðŸŽ§

 If you run `BetterBusylight.exe list` from a command line, it will pop up a message box that lists all the audio devices on your system. Simply enter an identifiable piece of text in the `searchString` attribute of the `<audioDevice>` node, and Better Busylight will monitor that device.
 
 For example, the device list on my machine looks like this:
 
![Message box](assets/deviceList.png)

My headset is made by 'MPOW' - so I might have `<audioDevice searchString="MPOW" />` as my configuration.

# Any ideas? ðŸ’¡

I'd love to hear if you have any ideas about how to make this app better. If you do, feel free to create an issue on the GitHub repository!

# Device support ðŸš¨

Currently, Better Busylight only supports the kuando Busylight products. If you have a different branch of light and you have a spare one, please get in touch!
