# Introduction ðŸ‘€

Better Busylight is busy light controller software that changes the light state based on audio sessions, web cam usage and system lock state. It was developed because I wanted the busylight to show I was actually in a call, rather than just red because there was an entry in my calendar.

This documentation is under construction.
